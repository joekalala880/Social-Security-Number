# Social-Security-Number
The program is a GUI-based Social Security Number (SSN) validator. It allows the user to input an SSN and validates it based on specific rules, including length, format, and prohibited patterns like starting with "9" or having "666" as a prefix.

An SSN is considered valid if it meets the following criteria as defined in your program:

Correct Format:

The SSN must have the format ###-##-#### (9 digits with dashes at positions 4 and 7).
No Leading "9":

The SSN cannot start with the digit 9.
Prefix Restrictions:

The first three digits (area number) cannot be 666 or 000.
Middle Group Restrictions:

The middle two digits (group number) cannot be 00.
Last Group Restrictions:

The last four digits (serial number) cannot be 0000.
Exactly 9 Digits:

The input must contain exactly 9 numerical digits.
